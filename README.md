client & requirments 
  The gaming room wants Draw it or lose it expanded from andriod to web and other platforms. I purposed a a java/dropeizard backend with a responsive web UI so it runs Linux, Windows, and mobile browsers. supports many rooms and players, strams imiages and protects user data.

What i did well
  Chosw linux hosting low cost and common. simple role-based security straight foward.

  What helped when coding
    The desighn doc defined data and rules up front, which made endpoints eaiser to implement.
What id revise
 I would like to be more technical in my explinations. I dint refrence as many launges, dev tools, or other specifics as i would have liked to.

 Interpreting user needs. 
   User needed mulit-platform, fast image loading, many games, and secure data. I used REST API, responsive UI, roles and image object storage. keeping the app simple and fast. If we dont make sure we meet consumer needs, we will have no users.

  Desighn approach next time.
  i started from the users goals and limits. turned that into sample stories. Then i outlined core game data, teams rounds player ect. I kept the design practical, i planned needs early, planned fore memory and imiage storage, as well as game data storage using a database.
  I would use, user stories+acceptance critra agian. I would also focuse and make sure i have a decent endgoal in mind so i can bake in features before the are needed or can be added when needed.
